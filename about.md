This is a blog where I write whatever I find interesting. So feel free to browse
and have fun. Here are some information on me that you may find interesting.
In case you want to contact me, my email is plastered all around in this Blog.
So use it.

My name is <span style="color:rgb(192,0,105)">Umberto Michelucci</span>. I am the founder of
[TOELT](http://toelt.ai) a startup that
is building the technology for the next generation of sensors that learns.
I work in several fields: Physics, Astronomy, image recognition, and whatever
I find interesting.
