My name is <span style="color:rgb(192,0,105)">Umberto Michelucci</span>. I am the founder of
[TOELT](http://toelt.ai) a startup that
is building the technology for the next generation of sensors that learns.
I work in several fields: Physics, Astronomy, image recognition, and whatever
I find interesting. I am also a Google Developer Expert in Machine learning
based in Switzerland.

At the moment my main interests are

- Theory of neural networks based on functional analysis

- Neural networks on embedded systems and IoT

- Application of Deep Learning to Phyics
