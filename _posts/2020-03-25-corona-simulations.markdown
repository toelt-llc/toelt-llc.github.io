In this post I compare two simulations of how the virus can spread
in case of a lockdown (many people stay home) and in case when
people can move around freely.

# Corona Virus simulations

I decided to create two animations that shows very clearly what is the
effect of a lockdown in the case of a pandemic (what we are experiencing now in March 2020
for the COVID-19 Virus).

In the first video below, you can see a simulation that shows how effective
are virus at spreading. In this simulation each subject (the dots) can
move around freely. Each time a subject touches (interact) with another
it can transmit the virus. The red dots are the sick subjects, the blue the
healthy ones. You can see how fast the virus spread.

In this second video I simulated the lockdown. 60% of the subjects can not
move (they stay home), and only 40% are able to move around freely.
In the same time window than the first video, you can see how less people
get infected this time.
