In January 2020 I held a talk at Google on TensorFlow 2.0, how
TPU are working, an introduction to TensorFlow Lite and I organised
a hands-on session on Google Coral Devices. Here are some impressions
of the day.

# TensorFlow 2.0 and TPUs Roadshow @ Google

The talk given at Google in ZÃ¼rich on the 16th of January
was a great success. The 70 available places were gone in a few hours and
we had a waiting list of 50 people that wanted to come. The event has been
organised by me, Fabien Tarrade and Nick Bortolotti from Google. The
meetup website can be found here: [https://www.meetup.com/Swiss-TensorFlow-Usergroup/events/266725502/](https://www.meetup.com/Swiss-TensorFlow-Usergroup/events/266725502/)

For the event I created an open GitHub repository that is completely free
